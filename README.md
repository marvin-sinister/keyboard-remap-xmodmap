# keyboard-remap-xmodmap

Remaps keys on keyboard under linux.
Use by running:
```
xmodmap Xmodmap
```
(or whatever you named the file)

My keyboards have UK layout, so it's tailored to that.
Replaces:
- GBP symbol for hash on number 3 key
- tilda (bakctick) with esacpe, while moving backtick to AltGr modifier
- CapsLock to Control
- Left Control to Super (or Windows key if you prefer)
